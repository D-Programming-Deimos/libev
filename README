libev D bindings
------------------

Introduction:

A full-featured and high-performance event loop that is loosely modelled after libevent, but without its limitations and bugs.

Features include child/pid watchers, periodic timers based on wallclock (absolute) time (in addition to timers using relative timeouts), as well as epoll/kqueue/event ports/inotify/eventfd/signalfd support, fast timer management, time jump detection and correction, and ease-of-use.
